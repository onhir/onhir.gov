> The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation is committed to providing a workplace that is free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment in the workplace is against the law and this agency has a zero tolerance policy. When the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation determines that an allegation of sexual harassment is credible, it will take prompt and appropriate corrective action.
> 
> **What Constitutes Sexual Harassment**
> 
> Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when:
> 
> *   An employment decision affecting that individual is made because the individual submitted to or rejected the unwelcome conduct, or
> *   The unwelcome conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or abusive work environment.
> 
> Certain behaviors, such as conditional promotions, awards, training or other job benefits upon acceptance of unwelcome actions of a sexual nature, are always wrong.
> 
> Unwelcome actions such as the following listed below are inappropriate and depending on the circumstances, may meet the definition of sexual harassment or contribute to a hostile work environment:
> 
> *   Sexual pranks, or repeated sexual teasing, or innuendo, in person or via e-mail
> *   Verbal abuse of a sexual nature
> *   Touching or grabbing of a sexual nature
> *   Repeatedly standing too close or brushing up against a person
> *   Repeatedly asking a person to socialize during off duty hours when the person has said no or has indicated he or she is not interested (supervisors in particular should be careful not to pressure their employees to socialize)
> *   Giving gifts or leaving objects that are sexually suggestive
> *   Repeatedly making sexually suggestive gestures
> *   Making or posting sexually demeaning or offensive pictures, cartoons, or other materials in the workplace,
> *   Off duty, unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that affects the work environment
> 
> A victim of sexual harassment can be a man or a woman. The victim can be of the same sex as the harasser. The harasser can be a supervisor, manager, co-worker, other office employee, or a non employee who has a business relationship with the agency.
> 
> **ONHIR Responsibilities Under This Policy**
> 
> If the ONHIR receives an allegation of sexual harassment, or has reason to believe sexual harassment is occurring, it will take the necessary steps to ensure that the matter is promptly investigated and addressed. If the allegation is determined to be credible, ONHIR is committed to take action if it learns of possible sexual harassment, even if the individual does not wish to file a formal complaint.
> 
> The Human Resources branch is the main contact point for questions or concerns about sexual harassment. The Human Resources branch has responsibility for investigating or overseeing investigations of alleged sexual harassment and is committed to ensuring that all investigations of sexual harassment are conducted in a prompt, thorough and impartial manner.
> 
> Supervisors and Managers and other responsible ONHIR officials who observe, are informed of, or reasonably suspect incidents of possible sexual harassment must immediately report such incidents to the Human Resources office which will initiate or oversee a prompt investigation. Failure to report such incidents to the Human Resources office will be considered a violation of this policy and may result in disciplinary action. The Human Resources office will provide guidance as needed on investigating and handling the potential harassment. Supervisors and Managers should take effective measures to ensure no further apparent or alleged harassment occurs pending completion of an investigation.
> 
> ONHIR will seek to protect the identities of the alleged victim and harasser, except as reasonably necessary (i.e. to complete an investigation successfully). The ONHIR will also take the necessary steps to protect from retaliation those employees who in good faith report incidents of potential sexual harassment. It is a violation of both federal law and this policy to retaliate against someone who has reported possible sexual harassment. Violators may be subject to discipline.
> 
> Employees who have been found by the ONHIR to have subjected another employee to unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, whether such behavior meets the legal definition of sexual harassment or not, will be subject to discipline or other appropriate management action. Discipline will be appropriate to the circumstances, ranging from a letter of reprimand through suspension without pay for varying lengths to separation for cause. A verbal or written admonishment, while not considered formal discipline, may also be considered.
> 
> **Employees Rights and Responsibilities**
> 
> Any employee who believes he or she has been the target of sexual harassment is encouraged to inform the offending person orally or in writing that such conduct is unwelcome and offensive and must stop. If the employee does not wish to communicate directly with the offending person, or if such communication has been ineffective, the employee has multiple avenues for reporting allegations of sexual harassment and/or pursuing resolution.
> 
> Employees are encouraged to report the unwelcome conduct as soon as possible to a responsible ONHIR official, such as a supervisor or manager, usually the supervisor or manager within the employee's supervisory chain, although it is not required. Responsible ONHIR officials include first or second line supervisors, the offending person's supervisor, the branch Manager, Human Resource office or the Executive Director.
> 
> All ONHIR employees, including but not limited to staff, supervisors, managers and senior officials, are required to comply with this policy. Employees are also expected to behave professionally and to exercise good judgment in work related relationships, whether with fellow employees, business colleagues, or members of the public with whom they come into contact in the course of official duties. Further, all employees are expected to take appropriate measures to prevent sexual harassment. Unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature should be stopped before it becomes severe or pervasive and rises to violation of law.
