**Our promise to you: writing you can understand**

We at the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) are committed to writing all of our new documents in plain language by October 2011.

Our goal is to use plain language in any document that:

*   Is necessary for obtaining any of our benefits;
*   Provides information about any of our benefits or;
*   Explains how to comply with a requirement that we administer

**Why we make this promise**

While we've been believers in plain language for a long time, the Plain Writing Act of 2010 rquires all federal agencies to write "clear government communication that the public can understand and use." President Obama also emphasized the importance of "transparency, public participation, and collaboration" in his January 21, 2009, Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government.

**Let us know how we're doing**

You can help us to meet our plain language goals by letting us know when we fall short. If you have trouble understanding any of our documents or any material on our Web site, please contact Scott Kuhr at [skuhr@onhir.gov](mailto:skuhr@onhir.gov?Subject=Public%20Inquiry%20on%20Plain%20Writing%20at%20ONHIR) or 928-779-2721.

We have to report on our Progress and compliance with the Plain Writing Act by July 13, 2011. We will post that annual report here.
