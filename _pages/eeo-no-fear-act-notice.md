**DATES:**  This notice is effective January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020

**SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:**

On May 15, 2002, Congress enacted the “Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002,” also known as the No FEAR Act.  One purpose of the Act is to “require that Federal agencies be accountable for violations of antidiscrimination and whistleblower protection laws.”   Public Law 107-174.  In support of this purpose, Congress found that “agencies cannot be run effectively if those agencies practice or tolerate discrimination.”  Public Law 107-174, title I, General Provision, section 101(1).

The Act also requires Federal agencies, including the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) to provide this notice to Federal employees, former Federal employees and applicants for Federal employment to inform you of the rights and protections available to you under the Federal antidiscrimination laws and whistleblower protection laws.

**Antidiscrimination Laws**

 A Federal agency cannot discriminate against an employee or applicant with respect to the terms, conditions or privileges of employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status or political affiliation.  Discrimination on these bases is prohibited by one or more of the following statutes:  5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1), 29 U.S.C. 206(d), 29 U.S.C. 631, 29 U.S.C. 633a, 29 U.S.C. 791 and 42 U.S.C 2000e-16.

If you believe that you have been the victim of unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin or disability, you must contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Counselor within 45 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory action, or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 calendar days of the effective date of the action, before you can file a formal complaint of discrimination with your agency.  See 19, C.F.R. part 1614.  The ONHIR Human Resources Department will provide you with contact information for the EEO Counselor.

If you believe that you have been the victim of unlawful discrimination on the basis of age, you must either contact the EEO counselor as noted above, or give notice of intent to sue to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 180 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory action.  If you are alleging discrimination based on marital status or political affiliation, you may file a  written complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC).  See contact information listed below.  

**Whistleblower Protection**

An ONHIR employee with authority to take, direct others to take, recommend or approve any personnel action must not use that authority to take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action against an employee or applicant because of disclosure of information by that individual that is reasonably  believed to evidence violations of law, rule or regulation; gross mismanagement; gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, unless disclosure of such information is specifically prohibited by law or such information is specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.

Retaliation against an employee or applicant for making a protected disclosure is prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8).  If you believe that you have been the victim of whistleblower retaliation, you may file a written complaint (Form OSC-11) with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) online at [http://www.osc.gov](http://www.osc.gov) or by mail:

                                                                U.S. Office of Special Counsel  
                                                                1730 M Street, N.W., Suite 218  
                                                                Washington, D.C. 20036-4505

**Retaliation of Engaging in Protected Activity**

The ONHIR cannot retaliate against an employee or applicant because that individual exercises his or her rights under any of the Federal antidiscrimination laws or whistleblower protection regulations listed above.  If you believe that you are the victim of retaliation for engaging in protected activity, you must follow, as appropriate, the procedures described in the Antidiscrimination Laws and Whistleblower Protection sections of this notice or, if applicable, the administrative or negotiated grievance procedures in order to pursue any legal remedy.

**Disciplinary Actions**

Under the existing laws, the ONHIR retains the right, where appropriate, to discipline an ONHIR employee for conduct that is inconsistent with Federal Antidiscrimination Laws and Whistleblower Protection regulations up to and including removal.   If ONHIR has initiated an investigation under 5 U.S.C. 1214, however, according to 5 U.S.C. 1214 (f), the ONHIR must seek approval from the Special Counsel to discipline employees for, among other activities, engaging in prohibited retaliation.  Nothing the No FEAR Act alters existing laws or permits the ONHIR to take unfounded disciplinary action against a Federal employee or to violate the procedural rights of a Federal employee who has been accused of discrimination.

**Additional Information**

For further information regarding the No FEAR Act refer to 5 C.F.R. 725.  Additional information regarding Federal antidiscrimination, whistleblower protection and retaliation laws can be found at the EEOC website, [https://www.eeoc.gov](http://www.eeoc.gov) and the OSC website, [https://www.osc.gov](http://www.osc.gov).

**Existing Rights Unchanged**

Pursuant to section 205 of the No FEAR Act, neither the Act nor this notice creates, expands or reduces any rights otherwise available to any employee, former employee or applicant under the laws of the United States, including the provisions of law specified in 5 U.S.C. 2302(d).
